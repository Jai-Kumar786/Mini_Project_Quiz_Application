JavaScript:
The JavaScript code at the bottom of the document handles form submission and calculates the quiz score.
It listens for the form submission event, prevents the default form submission behavior, and then calculates the score based on user-selected answers.
After calculating the score, it displays the result, highlighting correct and incorrect answers, and showing the score out of 5.
It uses DOM manipulation to add classes for correct and incorrect answers, and to display the result section.
scrollTo(0,0): Scrolls the page to the top when displaying the quiz result.
classList.add(): Adds CSS classes to elements to apply styling changes based on quiz results.
